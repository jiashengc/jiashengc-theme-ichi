                                            Hi! I'm Jia Sheng, I build web applications, and draw Chinese cartoons.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Originally from Taylor's University, Malaysia. I transferred to Queensland University of Technology (QUT) after completing my first year of studies in Malaysia.
                                            Currently, I'm completing a computer science major and an intelligent systems minor at QUT.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            I started programming since late 2015 where I was introduced to freecodecamp by my brother. 
                                            From that that day onwards, I kinda fell in love with web development and started playing around with it alot.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            During my time in Brisbane, I've finally won my first hackathon and gotten my first internship! Woohoo!<br>
                                            So I won the "Sphero" and "Tech" challenge for Angel Hack Brisbane '17 and was the winner of DisruptingEd Hackathon, and
                                            I also interned at RedEye Apps during the winter break and I'm currently building the MVP for a startup called Noshable at the University of Queensland.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            My spare time is usually spent on reading medium articles, drawing Chinese cartoons, and working on my visual novel project.
                                            Hopefully one day, I'll be able to finish the VN.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Feel free to contact me about the VN, web dev or whatever! I'm always interested in random stuff.
